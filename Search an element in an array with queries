Problem statement
You have given a sorted array 'A' of 'N' integers.

Now, you are given 'Q' queries, and each query consists of a single integer 'X'. Your task is to check whether 'X' is present in array 'A' or not for each query. If 'X' exists in array 'A', you need to print 1 else print 0.

Note :

The given array is sorted in non-decreasing order. 
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10 
1 <= N <= 10^5    
-10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9 
1 <= Q <= 10^4
-10^9 <= X <= 10^9

Where 'T' represents the number of test cases, 'N' represents the size of the array, 'A[i]' represents the elements of the array, 'Q' represents the number of queries and, 'X' denotes the number to be searched.
Time limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
1
5
1 3 5 7 8
2
5
2
Sample Output 1:
  1 0
Explanation for sample input 1:
For the first test case, the given array A is [1, 3, 5, 7,8].

So the answer for the given first query is 1 as 5 is present in the array.

For the second query answer is 0 as 2 is not present in the array.  
Sample Input 2:
1
6
1 2 2 3 4 10
3
5
7 
2
Sample Output 2:
 0 0 1
Explanation for sample input 2:
For the first test case, the given array A is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 10].

So the answer for the given first query is 0 as 5 is not present in the array.

For the given second query answer is 0 as 7 is not present in the array.  

For the given third query answer is 1 as 2 is present in the array.
